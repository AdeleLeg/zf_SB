# zf_SB (Swimming burst)

Zebrafish larval swimming burst is a parameter previously used as a measure to predict impulsive behaviour in zebrafish larvae to assess impulsivity (Lange et al., 2012).

As in Lange et al., (2012), we considered peaks all the acceleration events when the fish travelled > 5 mm in < 12 s. 

Burst performances are the highest speeds attainable by fish and can be maintained for only short periods of time (<20 seconds) (Beamish 1978). 
At burst speeds, energy is primarily supplied to myotomal (body) white muscle through anaerobic processes (Webb 1994).
