# zf_SB (Swimming burst)

Zebrafish larval swimming burst is a parameter previously used as a measure to predict impulsive behaviour in zebrafish larvae to assess impulsivity (Lange et al., 2012).

As in Lange et al., (2012), we considered peaks all the acceleration events when the fish travelled > 5 mm in < 12 s.
